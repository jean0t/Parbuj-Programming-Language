Parbuj is an interpreted programming language built from scratch using Golang. Currently, it supports operations only with integers and is in its early stages of development.

## Features

- **Interpreted:** Runs directly from source code without needing compilation.
- **Simple Operations:** Supports basic operations with integers.
- **REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop):** A simplified interactive interpreter is available.
- **Work in Progress:** Building parser, lexer, and expanding language functionality.

## Getting Started

To try out Parbuj, clone the repository and follow these steps:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jean0t/Parbuj-Programming-Language.git parbuj
cd parbuj
go run main.go
```

## Roadmap

- [x] Lexer implementation
- [x] Token definition
- [ ] Parser development
- [ ] Enhancing REPL functionality
- [ ] Extending the functions of the language
